Introduction
============

The datasheet for the DS3231 explains that this part is an 
"Extremely Accurate IÂ²C-Integrated RTC/TCXO/Crystal". And,
hey, it does exactly what it says on the tin! This Real Time 
Clock (RTC) is the most precise you can get in a small, low 
power package.

Most RTCs use an external 32kHz timing crystal that is used 
to keep time with low current draw. And that's all well and 
good, but those crystals have slight drift, particularly when 
the temperature changes (the temperature changes the oscillation 
frequency very very very slightly but it does add up!) This 
RTC is in a beefy package because the crystal is inside the 
chip! And right next to the integrated crystal is a temperature 
sensor. That sensor compensates for the frequency changes by 
adding or removing clock ticks so that the timekeeping stays 
on schedule.

This is the finest RTC you can get, and now we have it in a 
compact, breadboard-friendly breakout. With a coin cell 
plugged into the back, you can get years of precision 
timekeeping, even when main power is lost. Great for 
datalogging and clocks, or anything where you need to 
really know the time.
